# Online-Movie-Subscription-with-Django
This project presents an overview of online movie subscription which is a software solution. Easy and convenient interface, where admin can view, update, add and delete attributes like actor, director, movie, casting, customer and book the movie to the customer. The necessary requirements are being available and visible in this project. The project is done using the Django and is made easy to view the availibility.


In this project, I have provided the details of Django based REST API Development for
Online Movie Subcription . At the admin, admin can add the customer and book the movie
including the details of desired actor and director. And also view the name and appointment
requested by the user. The user will be informed if the email they are using to register if it
was used before and also if the user is providing invalid format. The user can easily book
the appointment without visiting the movie centres.
